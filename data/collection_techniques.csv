Astereae,"the pappus will look like poof balls perched on the capitulum, grab them with hands", 
Phacelia,"wear gloves, hairs NOT soft when plant is mature; shake inflorescence above collection vessel", 
Peritoma,"when fully mature pods will open, collect the pods which feel full just above those on plant", 
Astragalus,"pods will open when mature; hand strip legumes just before this phase, they should rip away cleanly from the stipe", 
Dalea,cut whole inflorescence off from the base, 
Sphaeralcea,acquire expert ID first; cut off inflorescence at base (shears-scissors/knife) into bag, 
Stipeae,hand strip seed up along inflorescence, 
Achnatherum hymenoides,"grab a section of inflorescence in one hand, and with scissors cut the branches free from base and drop into bag; or hand strip seed",
